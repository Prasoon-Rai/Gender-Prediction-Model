# Gender Prediction Model (Height & Age)

This repository contains a deep learning model that predicts gender based on a person's height and age. Built with TensorFlow and Keras, the model follows a simple sequential architecture and is trained on a synthetic dataset created for demonstration purposes.

## 🔧 Features

- Predicts gender using height and age as input features.
- Built using TensorFlow and Keras (Sequential model).
- Includes:
  - Synthetic dataset generation
  - Model training and evaluation
  - Pre-trained model for direct use
  - Jupyter Notebook walkthrough for understanding the development process

## 🧠 Model Overview

The model is a fully connected feed-forward neural network trained to classify gender as either:
- Female
- Male

### Input:
- Height (in inches)
- Weight (in pounds)

### Output:
- Probability score mapped to binary class (0 or 1)
